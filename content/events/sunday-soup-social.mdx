After the service, stay and enjoy a comforting soup and roll fellowship lunch with us. It’s a simple yet nourishing way to share good food and even better company. Whether you're new or a regular, everyone is welcome around the table as we take time to connect, chat, and enjoy a warm meal together. There's no need to bring anything — just yourself and an appetite for both food and fellowship!
